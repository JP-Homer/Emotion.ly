What do all these files do?

There is essentially only one file and three jsons that are used in conjunction to frontend during runtime
and that is:
-functionsNeeded.py
-./jsonFiles/rankedEmotionsSublist.json
-./jsonFiles/rankedEmotionsSublistObjects.json
-./jsonFiles/defEmotionMapSlimmed.json

 the other files are all what we used to produce the data we are using. If these files are run in a certain 
 order they can reproduce the required data at a moments notice. While we could merge these files into one,
 each file does not affect the files in the chain behind it so if we want to change a data criteria it becomes
 very easy to change a step in the chain. Also if we were to lose all of our json data or it becomes corrupted
 we could easily recreate it.

 Order Parsers Need To Be Called:
