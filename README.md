# Emotion.ly

Our project is a coding tool that helps users express their emotions more effectively in writing. Given a sentence, it suggests alternative emotional words for the adjectives used in the sentence. This allows users to convey their feelings with more precision and nuance, making their writing more impactful. Whether you're crafting a heartfelt message or writing a creative piece, our tool empowers you to express your emotions in a way that truly resonates with your audience.
